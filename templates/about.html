        <p>After growing up in the Washington DC suburbs I've moved around a bit, living in the Chicago area, Denver,
            and now Tucson, AZ. I love southern Arizona, home to the Sonoran desert, and all it has to offer. From the
            year-long summer, to the gorgeous mountain ranges, to the desert landscapes that are unique from everywhere
            I've lived prior, there's always opportunities to adventure somewhere new.

            I am an avid mountain biker (follow me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/20473650">Strava</a>!),
            you'll regularly find me going down the trails of Mount Lemmon. I used to do a lot of running, but that
            hobby has been derailed by injuries. Most days I unwind by spending some time at local dog parks with my dog

        and computer science (<a href="https://oregonstate.edu/">OSU</a>). My personal interests lean toward exploring
        methods in scientific computing (particularly cryptography, numerical analysis, among other topics) and learning
        new programming languages. Previously I've worked at <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Research</a>,
        helping build the scientific computing software <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>,
