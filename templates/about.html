        <p>After growing up in the Washington DC suburbs I have since moved around a bit, living in the Chicago area,
            Denver, and now Tucson, AZ. I love southern Arizona and all it has to offer. From the
            year-long summer to the gorgeous mountain ranges there's always opportunities to adventure somewhere new.
            <br><br>
            I am an avid mountain biker (follow me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/20473650">Strava</a>!),
            you'll regularly find me going down the trails of Mount Lemmon. I used to do a lot of running but that
            hobby has been derailed by injuries. Most days I unwind by spending some time at local dog parks with my dog

        I am presently a software developer at <a href="https://www.rincon.com/">Rincon Research</a>, working on
        high-performance DSP products and services. I have degrees in mathematics (<a href="https://cnu.edu/">CNU</a>)
        and computer science (<a href="https://oregonstate.edu/">OSU</a>). My personal interests lean toward exploring
        methods in scientific computing (particularly cryptography, numerical analysis, among other topics) and learning
        new programming languages. Previously I've helped build the scientific computing software <a
            href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>,
        worked on <a href="https://www.geost.com/">high-powered telescopes</a> and optical systems to keep
        track of artificial satellites in earth's orbit, and worked on <a href="https://rebelliondefense.com/">sensor
            fusion/tracking</a> software to assist automous aircraft.</p>
